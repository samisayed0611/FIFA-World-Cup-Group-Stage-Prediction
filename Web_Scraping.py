# What do we plan to do?
# 1) make a GET request to the FIFA Tournaments page, using the Request library
# 2) save content (HTML) of FIFA Tournaments page in a Beautiful Soup format 
# 3) find URLs to all FIFA World Cup editions, slice URLs to add '/groups', save new URLs in a list
# 4) make a GET request to all FIFA World Cup pages, one by one, and save group's data in a list
# 5) concatanate data from all FIFA World Cup pages into a one Pandas' dataframe 
# 6) export dataframe to Excel for further manipulation
